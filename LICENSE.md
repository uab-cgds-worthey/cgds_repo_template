# License

## When does a license need to be added

Before the repo goes public. It may also be necessary when shared with non-CGDS members.

## How do I choose the license

**Please discuss with SciOps program manager to choose and apply the appropriate license**. See [this wrike
task](https://www.wrike.com/open.htm?id=1018179846) for CGDS's discussion on licensing.

## Can I choose my own license

No.

## What does it mean when a repo has no license
