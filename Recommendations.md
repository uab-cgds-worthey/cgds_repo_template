# CGDS Recommendations

## IDE

An [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) is a
software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development and for looking at files and
folders in user-friendly manner. Our recommendations are listed below. You are not required to use them but please do
make sure IDE of your choice is as capable as those in our list.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * Visual Studio Code (or VScode) is a general purpose IDE and is the primary recommendation for most use-cases at
    CGDS.
  * Extensions/plugins can be installed as per your needs to make VSCode more powerful. Here are the plugins that would
    form a good starter-pack at CGDS. Note that [EditorConfig for VS
    Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) plugin is necessary to use thie
    template repo.
